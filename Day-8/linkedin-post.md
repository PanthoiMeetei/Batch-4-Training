🚀 **Day 8 of AWS DevOps Batch 4: Mastering EBS Volumes & Snapshots** 

Today we dove deep into AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) - the backbone of persistent storage in the cloud! 💾

**What we covered:**
✅ EBS Volume Types (gp3, gp2, io2, st1, sc1) and their use cases
✅ Hands-on volume creation, attachment, and formatting
✅ EBS Snapshots for backup and disaster recovery
✅ Data restoration from snapshots
✅ Automation scripts for snapshot management
✅ Performance optimization and cost management

**Key Practical Exercise:**
🔧 Created EC2 instance with additional 10GB EBS volume
🔧 Formatted and mounted volume with persistent configuration
🔧 Simulated data loss and successfully restored from snapshot
🔧 Implemented automated backup scripts with retention policies

**Real-world Impact:**
💡 EBS snapshots are incremental - only changed blocks are stored
💡 Cross-region snapshot copying enables disaster recovery
💡 Proper volume types can reduce costs by up to 20%
💡 Automation prevents human errors in backup processes

**Student Achievements:**
👨‍💻 Successfully managed complete EBS lifecycle
👨‍💻 Built production-ready automation scripts
👨‍💻 Implemented data recovery procedures
👨‍💻 Optimized storage costs and performance

The hands-on approach with real AWS resources gives our students practical experience they can immediately apply in production environments! 🎯
