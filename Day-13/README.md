## 🎯 What is AWS VPC?

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of IP address ranges, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.

### Key Benefits:
- **Network Isolation**: Logically isolated from other virtual networks
- **Complete Control**: Full control over networking configuration
- **Security**: Multiple layers of security including security groups and NACLs
- **Connectivity Options**: Various ways to connect to on-premises networks
- **Scalability**: Easily scale your network as your requirements grow

## 🏗️ VPC Core Components

### 1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- **Definition**: Your own isolated network within AWS
- **IP Range**: Defined by CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16)
- **Region Specific**: Spans all Availability Zones in a region
- **Default vs Custom**: AWS provides default VPC, you can create custom VPCs

### 2. Subnets
- **Definition**: Subdivision of VPC's IP address range
- **AZ Specific**: Each subnet exists in exactly one Availability Zone
- **Types**:
  - **Public Subnet**: Has route to Internet Gateway
  - **Private Subnet**: No direct route to internet
  - **VPN-only Subnet**: Has route to Virtual Private Gateway only

### 3. Internet Gateway (IGW)
- **Purpose**: Provides internet access to VPC
- **Characteristics**:
  - Horizontally scaled, redundant, highly available
  - One IGW per VPC
  - Supports IPv4 and IPv6 traffic

### 4. NAT Gateway/Instance
- **Purpose**: Allows private subnet resources to access internet
- **NAT Gateway**: AWS managed, highly available
- **NAT Instance**: EC2 instance, customer managed
- **Outbound Only**: Prevents inbound connections from internet

### 5. Route Tables
- **Definition**: Contains rules (routes) that determine network traffic direction
- **Components**:
  - **Destination**: IP address range
  - **Target**: Gateway, interface, or connection
- **Types**: Main route table, custom route tables

### 6. Security Groups
- **Function**: Virtual firewall for EC2 instances
- **Characteristics**:
  - Stateful (return traffic automatically allowed)
  - Allow rules only (no deny rules)
  - Instance level security

### 7. Network ACLs (Access Control Lists)
- **Function**: Subnet-level firewall
- **Characteristics**:
  - Stateless (must allow both inbound and outbound)
  - Allow and deny rules
  - Numbered rules processed in order

## 🌐 VPC Networking Concepts

### CIDR Blocks (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
```
VPC CIDR Examples:
- 10.0.0.0/16    (65,536 IP addresses)
- 172.16.0.0/12  (1,048,576 IP addresses)
- 192.168.0.0/16 (65,536 IP addresses)

Subnet CIDR Examples:
- 10.0.1.0/24    (256 IP addresses)
- 10.0.2.0/24    (256 IP addresses)
- 10.0.3.0/24    (256 IP addresses)
```

### Reserved IP Addresses
In every subnet, AWS reserves 5 IP addresses:
- **Network address**: 10.0.1.0 (first IP)
- **VPC router**: 10.0.1.1 (second IP)
- **DNS server**: 10.0.1.2 (third IP)
- **Future use**: 10.0.1.3 (fourth IP)
- **Broadcast**: 10.0.1.255 (last IP)

### Elastic IP Addresses
- **Static IPv4 addresses** designed for dynamic cloud computing
- **Associated** with AWS account, not specific instance
- **Remappable** to any instance in your account
- **Charged** when not associated with running instance

## 🔒 VPC Security

### Defense in Depth Strategy
```
Internet → IGW → Route Table → NACL → Security Group → EC2 Instance
```

### Security Groups vs NACLs Comparison

| Feature | Security Groups | Network ACLs |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Level** | Instance | Subnet |
| **State** | Stateful | Stateless |
| **Rules** | Allow only | Allow and Deny |
| **Rule Processing** | All rules evaluated | Rules processed in order |
| **Default** | Deny all inbound, Allow all outbound | Allow all traffic |

### Best Security Practices
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required access
2. **Layer Security**: Use both Security Groups and NACLs
3. **Regular Audits**: Review and update security rules
4. **Monitoring**: Use VPC Flow Logs for traffic analysis
5. **Encryption**: Use encryption in transit and at rest

## 🛣️ VPC Routing

### Route Table Concepts
- **Main Route Table**: Default for all subnets
- **Custom Route Tables**: Created for specific routing needs
- **Route Priority**: Most specific route takes precedence
- **Local Route**: Always present, enables VPC internal communication

### Common Routing Scenarios
```
Public Subnet Route Table:
Destination: 10.0.0.0/16    Target: Local
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0      Target: igw-xxxxxxxx

Private Subnet Route Table:
Destination: 10.0.0.0/16    Target: Local
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0      Target: nat-xxxxxxxx

VPN Subnet Route Table:
Destination: 10.0.0.0/16    Target: Local
Destination: 192.168.0.0/16 Target: vgw-xxxxxxxx
```

## 🎤 Interview Questions & Answers

### Fresher Level Questions

**Q1: What is AWS VPC?**
**A:** AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated section of AWS Cloud where you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over networking configuration including IP ranges, subnets, route tables, and gateways.

**Q2: What is the difference between public and private subnets?**
**A:** 
- **Public Subnet**: Has a route to Internet Gateway, resources can have public IPs and internet access
- **Private Subnet**: No direct route to internet, resources use NAT Gateway/Instance for outbound internet access

**Q3: What is an Internet Gateway?**
**A:** Internet Gateway (IGW) is a VPC component that allows communication between instances in VPC and the internet. It's horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available. One IGW can be attached per VPC.

**Q4: What are Security Groups?**
**A:** Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. They are stateful (return traffic automatically allowed) and support allow rules only.

**Q5: What is CIDR notation?**
**A:** CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a method for allocating IP addresses. For example, 10.0.0.0/16 means the first 16 bits are network bits, providing 65,536 IP addresses (2^16).

### Intermediate Level Questions

**Q6: Explain the difference between Security Groups and NACLs.**
**A:** 
- **Security Groups**: Instance-level, stateful, allow rules only, all rules evaluated
- **NACLs**: Subnet-level, stateless, allow and deny rules, rules processed in numerical order

**Q7: What is NAT Gateway and when would you use it?**
**A:** NAT Gateway allows instances in private subnets to access the internet for outbound connections while preventing inbound connections from the internet. It's AWS-managed, highly available, and used for software updates, API calls, etc.

**Q8: How does VPC Peering work?**
**A:** VPC Peering creates a private network connection between two VPCs. Traffic routes privately using AWS backbone. It's non-transitive, supports cross-region and cross-account connections, and requires non-overlapping CIDR blocks.

**Q9: What are VPC Endpoints and their types?**
**A:** VPC Endpoints provide private connectivity to AWS services without internet access. Types:
- **Gateway Endpoints**: For S3 and DynamoDB (route table entries)
- **Interface Endpoints**: For other services using PrivateLink (ENI with private IP)

**Q10: Explain VPC Flow Logs.**
**A:** VPC Flow Logs capture network traffic information for VPC, subnet, or network interface. They help with security analysis, troubleshooting, and compliance. Logs can be sent to CloudWatch, S3, or Kinesis.
