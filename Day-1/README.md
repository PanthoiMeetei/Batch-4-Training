- Set up robust monitoring, logging, and alerting systems.
- Implement security best practices in cloud environments.
- Troubleshoot and optimize cloud-native applications.
- Master containerization and orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes.
- Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipelines with modern DevOps tools.

### Course Duration
- **Total Duration:** 13-14 Weeks
- **Sessions per Week:** 3 (Theory + Hands-on)
- **Session Duration:** 2 hours each
- **Total Hours:** 76 hours

## Today's Agenda: Cloud Technologies and AWS Introduction

### 1. Cloud Computing Concepts and Benefits
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, from a cloud provider like AWS.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Cost Savings:** Pay only for what you use, reducing capital expenditure.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
- **Agility:** Access new resources and services quickly.
- **Global Reach:** Deploy applications in multiple locations around the world with just a few clicks.

### 2. AWS Global Infrastructure
AWS has the most extensive global cloud infrastructure. The infrastructure is built around Regions and Availability Zones (AZs).
- **Regions:** A physical location in the world where AWS has multiple Availability Zones. Regions are isolated from each other.
- **Availability Zones (AZs):** Consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities.
- **Edge Locations:** A network of data centers designed to deliver services with the lowest latency possible. They are used by services like Amazon CloudFront (CDN) to cache content closer to end-users.

### 3. AWS Pricing Models
AWS offers a flexible, pay-as-you-go approach for pricing for over 200 cloud services.
- **On-Demand:** Pay for compute or database capacity by the hour or the second with no long-term commitments.
- **Reserved Instances (RIs):** Provides a significant discount (up to 72%) compared to On-Demand pricing in exchange for a 1- or 3-year commitment.
- **Spot Instances:** Request spare AWS EC2 computing capacity for up to 90% off the On-Demand price. Ideal for fault-tolerant and flexible applications.

### 4. AWS Management Console and Service Overview
The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface for accessing and managing your AWS services. You can manage everything from your EC2 instances to your S3 storage buckets through this single, intuitive UI. We will navigate the console to get familiar with its layout and key services.

### 5. AWS CLI Installation and Configuration
The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services from a terminal. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services and automate them through scripts. We will cover the steps to install it on your local machine and configure it with your AWS credentials.

## Hands-on Lab: Getting Started with AWS

In this lab, you will:
1. Create a free-tier AWS account.
2. Navigate the AWS Management Console.
3. Launch your first EC2 instance.
4. Create and configure an S3 bucket.
5. Explore other key AWS services.

**Note:** Ensure you follow the best practices for account security, including the use of MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).

## Conclusion and Q&A
Today, we laid the foundation for the rest of the course. We explored the basics of cloud computing, delved into AWS's global infrastructure, and familiarized ourselves with the AWS Management Console and CLI. In our next session, we will dive deeper into AWS core services. Please ensure you complete the hands-on lab and come prepared with any questions.
