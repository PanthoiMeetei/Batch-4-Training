## üé§ Interview Questions

**Q1: What is the difference between `ls -l` and `ls -la`?**
**A:** `ls -l` shows detailed listing of visible files, while `ls -la` shows detailed listing including hidden files (files starting with dot).

**Q2: How do you create nested directories in one command?**
**A:** Use `mkdir -p path/to/nested/directory`. The `-p` flag creates parent directories as needed.

**Q3: What's the difference between `rm -r` and `rm -rf`?**
**A:** `rm -r` removes directories recursively with confirmation prompts, while `rm -rf` forces removal without prompts.

**Q4: How do you view the last 20 lines of a file?**
**A:** Use `tail -n 20 filename` or `tail -20 filename`.

**Q5: What command shows your current directory?**
**A:** `pwd` (Print Working Directory) shows the current directory path.

## üéØ Key Takeaways

1. **Navigation**: Master `pwd`, `ls`, `cd` for directory navigation
2. **File Operations**: Use `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm` for file management
3. **Viewing Files**: `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail` for content viewing
4. **System Info**: `uname`, `whoami`, `df`, `free` for system status
5. **Help**: `man`, `--help`, `info` for command documentation
6. **Practice**: Regular practice builds muscle memory
7. **Safety**: Always double-check before using `rm -rf`
